# Standard MARSS model

There is growing interest in the use of first-order vector autoregressive, or VAR(1), models in ecology where they are often referred to as multivariate autoregressive, or MAR(1), models\footnote{See Ives et al. (2003) $Ecol ~ Monogr$ 73:301–330)}. 

## Process equation

The underlying process in a MAR(1) model is a discrete time version of a multivariate Gompterz equation for $n$ "species", which is typically written as

$$
\mathbf{x}_t = \mathbf{B} \mathbf{x}_{t-1} + \mathbf{w}_t,
$$

where $\mathbf{x}_t$ is an $n \times 1$ vector of state variates at time $t$, $\mathbf{B}$ is an $n \times n$ matrix of interaction strengths, and $\mathbf{w}_t$ is an $n \times 1$ vector of multivariate normal process errors; $\mathbf{w}_t \sim \text{MVN}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{Q})$.

Often we would like to include the effects of some number $p$ of external drivers of the system, whether they be environmental ($e.g.$, temperature) or anthropogenic ($e.g.$, harvest). In those cases, the model is expanded to

$$
\mathbf{x}_t = \mathbf{B} \mathbf{x}_{t-1} + \mathbf{C} \mathbf{c}_{t-h} + \mathbf{w}_t,
$$
where $\mathbf{C}$ is an $n \times p$ matrix of covariate effects, and $\mathbf{c}_t$ is a $p \times 1$ vector of covariates at time $t-h$ where $0 \leq h < T$.

## Observation equation

This process model can be used within a state-space framework wherein we add a second model for the observed data $\mathbf{y}$, such that

$$
\mathbf{y}_t = \mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{v}_t,
$$

$\mathbf{a}$ is an $n \times 1$ vector of offsets, and $\mathbf{v}_t$ is an $n \times 1$ vector of observation errors; $\mathbf{v}_t \sim \text{MVN}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{R})$. Note that if the variates in $\mathbf{y}$ have been scaled to have zero mean, then $\mathbf{a}$ can be dropped from the equation.

# Compact MARSS model

## Process equation

The above MARSS model can be rewritten in a more compact form. Beginning with the process equation, we can redefine the MAR(1) model as

$$
\mathbf{x}_t^* = \mathbf{B}^* \mathbf{x}_{t-1}^* + \mathbf{w}_t^* ~ \text{with} ~ \mathbf{w}_t^* \sim \text{MVN}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{Q}^*),
$$

given

$$
\mathbf{x}_t^* = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{x}_t \\
    \mathbf{c}_{t-h}
\end{bmatrix},
$$

$$
\mathbf{B}^* = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{B} & \mathbf{C}\\
    \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0}
\end{bmatrix},
$$

Here $\mathbf{I}_p$ is a $p \times p$ identity matrix. Thus, these vectors and matrices will have new dimensions, such that $\mathbf{x}_t^*$ is $(n + p) \times 1$, $\mathbf{B}_t^*$ is $(n + p) \times (n + p)$, and $\mathbf{Q}_t^*$ is also $(n + p) \times (n + p)$.

### Option 1

If all of the covariates have been scaled to have zero mean and unit variance, then

$$
\mathbf{Q}^* = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{Q} & \mathbf{0}\\
    \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{I}_p
\end{bmatrix}. 
$$

### Option 2

If, however, the covariates have not been scaled, then $\mathbf{Q}$ must be modified, such that 

$$
\mathbf{Q}^* = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{Q} & \mathbf{0}\\
    \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{S}
\end{bmatrix},
$$

and the $p \times p$ matrix $\mathbf{S}$ contains the variances of each of the $p$ covariates along the diagonal and 0’s elsewhere ($i.e.$, they are specified $a ~ priori$ and not estimated). Specifically,

$$
\mathbf{S} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \text{Var}(c_1) & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & \ddots & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & \text{Var}(c_p)
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

## Observation equation

The observation equation is rewritten as

$$
\mathbf{y}_t^* = \mathbf{x}_t^* + \mathbf{a}^* + \mathbf{v}_t^* ~ \text{with} ~ \mathbf{v}_t^* \sim \text{MVN}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{R}^*),
$$

with

$$
\mathbf{y}_t^* = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{y}_t \\
    \mathbf{c}_t
\end{bmatrix},
$$

$$
\mathbf{R}^* = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{R} & \mathbf{0}\\
    \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0}
\end{bmatrix}. 
$$

These new vectors and matrices will have dimensions where $\mathbf{y}_t^*$ is an $(n + p) \times 1$ column vector and $\mathbf{R}_t^*$ is an $(n + p) \times (n + p)$ matrix.

### Option 1

If all of the covariates have been scaled to have zero mean and unit variance, then 

$$
\mathbf{a}^* = \mathbf{0}.
$$

### Option 2

If the covariates have not been scaled, then a $p \times 1$ vector $\mathbf{a}$ containing covariate means must be included in the $(n + p) \times 1$ column vector $\mathbf{a}^*$ , such that

$$
\mathbf{a}^* = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{0} \\
    \mathbf{a}
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

As with $\mathbf{S}$ above, the covariate-specific means are specified in $\mathbf{a}$ rather than estimated.
