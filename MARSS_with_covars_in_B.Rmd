# Standard MARSS model

There is growing interest in the use of first-order vector autoregressive, or VAR(1), models in ecology where they are often referred to as multivariate autoregressive, or MAR(1), models ($e.g.$, Ives $et \ al$. 2003 $Ecol \ Monographs$ 73:301â€“330). 

## Process equation

The underlying process in a MAR(1) model is a discrete time version of a Gompterz equation, which is typically written as

$$
\mathbf{x}_t = \mathbf{B} \mathbf{x}_{t-1} + \mathbf{w}_t,
$$

where $\mathbf{x}_t$ is an $n \times 1$ vector of state variates at time $t$, $\mathbf{B}$ is an $n \times n$ matrix of interaction strengths, and $\mathbf{w}_t$ is an $n \times 1$ vector of multivariate normal process errors; $\mathbf{w}_t \sim \text{MVN}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{Q})$.

Often we would like to include the effects of some number $p$ of external drivers of the system, whether they be environmental ($e.g.$, temperature) or anthropogenic ($i.e.$, harvest). In those cases, the model is expanded to

$$
\mathbf{x}_t = \mathbf{B} \mathbf{x}_{t-1} + \mathbf{C} \mathbf{c}_{t-h} + \mathbf{w}_t,
$$
where $\mathbf{C}$ is an $n \times p$ matrix of covariate effects, and $\mathbf{c}_t$ is a $p \times 1$ vector of covariates at time $t-h$ where $0 \leq h < T$.

## Observation equation

This process model can be used within a state-space framework wherein we add a second model for the observed data $\mathbf{y}$, such that

\begin{gather*}
\mathbf{x}_t = \mathbf{B} \mathbf{x}_{t-1} + \mathbf{C} \mathbf{c}_{t-h} + \mathbf{w}_t, \\
\mathbf{y}_t = \mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{v}_t,
\end{gather*}

$\mathbf{a}$ is an $n \times 1$ vector of offsets, and $\mathbf{v}_t$ is an $n \times 1$ vector of observation errors; $\mathbf{v}_t \sim \text{MVN}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{R})$.

# Compact MARSS model

## Process equation

The above MARSS model can be rewritten in a more compact form, if we make some assumptions about the time lag $h$ for the covariates. Beginning with the process equation, if $h = 1$ and all of the covariates have been scaled to have zero mean and unit variance, then we can redefine the MAR(1) model as

$$
\mathbf{x}_t^* = \mathbf{B}^* \mathbf{x}_{t-1}^* + \mathbf{w}_t^* ~ \text{with} ~ \mathbf{w}_t^* \sim \text{MVN}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{Q}^*),
$$

with the following definitions:

$$
\mathbf{x}_t^* = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{x}_t \\
    \mathbf{c}_t
\end{bmatrix},
$$

$$
\mathbf{B}^* = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{B} & \mathbf{C}\\
    \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0}
\end{bmatrix},
$$

$$
\mathbf{Q}^* = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{Q} & \mathbf{0}\\
    \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{I}_m
\end{bmatrix}.
$$
